# Carmen Accuracy
This check the accuracy of the carmen library as a geolocation tool for twitter data. 

For the code to work, you need 14 json files names 1 to 14.json, some of the files were too big to upload and hence only a few were provided. You can stream your own live tweets and create the rest of the files.
